What is Convolutional Neural Network?

Convolutional Neural Network is CNN is a class of deep neural detwork in deep learning. they are one of kind variant artificial neural network. CNN were inspired by biological processess in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. CNN are regularized version of multilayer perceptron.
I try to make rock paper scissors to implement CNN with callback function, and also dropout
this is the submission from dicoding academy
